Initial test configs: 
Model size - train8-dem & train8-rep (16k) + test4-dem & test4-rep (16k) + train8-unsup (16k)
Epochs - 10
Logistic Regression - 66% accuracy

Initial clustering tests:
Same model as above
Test data - test5-unsup
Accuracy - 50.82%
Concerns - unbalanced cluster sizes

Possible paths: kn-means
